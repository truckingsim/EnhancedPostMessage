##EnhancedPostMessage

An easy way to do 1 and 2 way communication across multiple frames/windows.  Supports adding events programatically, and triggering events at any time after being instantiated.

Working example can be found at [https://truckingsim.github.io/EnhancedPostMessage](https://truckingsim.github.io/EnhancedPostMessage).  These examples show simple 1 way communication, 1 way communication passing data, simple 2 way communication, and 2 way communication passing data to achieve 2 way data-binding between frames.

### Usage
-----------------

Minified and gzipped, EnhancedPostMessage is around 1KB.  To use EnhancedPostMessage you must include the plugin in every frame that will send or listen to post messages.  For example, if you have a bookmarklet and that bookmarklet creates an iframe you wish to communicate with, you will need to include EnahncedPostMessage in both the bookmarklet's code (or create a `script` tag and append it to the body) AND the iframe's source (e.g. in `href="/path/to/iframe/html"`).

The plugin works by using the data given to the trigger, plus your initialization data, to build a meta-data structure that is then sent for the `postMessage`. This enables custom event name and custom listeners.  Due to the custom data structure, the plugin is needed on both sides.  If you have multiple sources, e.g., a parent page, an iframe, and a window created with `window.open`, you will need to include EnhancedPostMessage in **each** frame.  No exceptions.

Any caveats with `window.postMessage` also apply to EnhancedPostMessage.  For example, in IE10 and below, `window.postMessage` does not work if you create a new window with `window.open` that is cross origin, however creating a new iframe that is cross-origin is just fine.

This plugin merely leverages existing functionality that is built into most browsers and provides a developer-friendly API. To see if your browser will work with EnhancedPostMessage, please check [here](http://caniuse.com/#search=postmessage).

### Options
-----------------
####stringify
> __Type:__ `Boolean`
> __Default:__ `false`
> Only set to true if you wish to support IE9 and/or IE8.  Every other browser can pass objects through postMessage.
####sources
> __Type:__ `Object`
> 
> List of sources where the value is a single dom element
>
> ```js
> {
>   sources: {
>     source1: document.getElementById('test'),
>     // If using jQuery you can accomplish the same way using the following
>     source2: $('#test')[0]
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> A special internal reserved word of parent is used for sending an event back to the parent frame.  No source can use this name.

####events
> __Type:__ `Object`
> 
> The events to listen for in a `name: value` type of way
>> _value_ - __Type:__ `Object|Function|True`
>>
>> The value of an event can be an object that is passed to the listener, a function that is called with the data sent from the trigger and a object is returned, or `true` which means we just trigger the listener on the source with no data passed.
> 
> ```js
> {
>   events: {
>     exTrue: true,
>     exFunc: function(data){
>       // do some manipulation to data
>       return newData;
>     },
>     exObj: {
>       test: 'data'
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

####listeners
> __Type:__ `Object`
>
> The callbacks to be called on when an event is triggered.  
>
> ```js
> {
>   listeners: {
>     listener1: function(data){
>       // If any data is passed the first param will contain that data.
>       //    Otherwise the first param will be `undefined`
>
>       $('#html').html(data);
>       // Anything else...
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

There are no required options, and any option can be added at a later time after the plugin has been instantiated through one of the following methods:

### Methods
-------
####addEvent
```js
EnhancedPostMessage('addEvent', 'eventName', 'Object|Function|True');
```

####addListener
```js
var FunctionToBeCalled = function(data){};
EnhancedPostMessage('addListener', 'listenerName', FunctionToBeCalled);
```

####addSource
```js
EnhancedPostMessage('addSource', 'sourceName', document.getElementById('sourceId');
```
-----
###trigger
`trigger(event, source, data)`:

>* event:
>> __Required__
>>
>> __Type:__ `String`
>>
>> The name of the event you wish to be triggered
>
>* source:
>> __Required__
>>
>> __Type:__ `String`
>>
>> The name of the source you wish the event to be triggered on
>
>* data:
>> __Optional__
>>
>> __Type:__ `String|Object`
>> 
>> Any data you wish to send to the event, if the event is a function.  If the event is an object, the event's object will override the data passed.  If the event is a bool `true` then the data will be passed as is to the listener.

>**Example:**
>```js
EnhancedPostMessage.trigger('exEvent1', 'source1', {data: {to: {be: 'passed'}}});
```
